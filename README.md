# ASK Smart Learning Platform

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://arya11software.github.io/ask-smart-learning-platform/

A system-designed, modular skill intelligence platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Engineered to simulate a scalable learning ecosystem with assessment engine, dynamic roadmap generation, resume builder, analytics dashboard, and gamified learning modules.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Students lack structured visibility into:
- Skill gaps
- Personalized learning paths
- Measurable progress tracking
- Resume alignment with technical growth

ASK Smart solves this by integrating:

• Skill assessment engine  
• Dynamic roadmap generator  
• Analytics dashboard  
• Resume builder  
• Gamified learning modules  
• Profile and performance tracking  

All delivered as a deployable production web application.
